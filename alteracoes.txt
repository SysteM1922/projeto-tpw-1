User Stories (Extra) - tem em conta a edição e pesquisa de clans.


## Scenario

In order to do this she uses Clanly to create a new Clan: CatLovers.

First off, shes creates a new account by clicking on Sign Up, filling out her information accordingly.

Nextly, shes signs in with her newly created credentials.

Seeing her timeline, she clicks on the Menu button in order to reveal the My Clans option, that will take her to the My Clans page.

On this page, she uses the button assigned to creating a new Clan and fills out the information to her suiting.

She now returns to the My Clans page, clicking on the CatLovers clan in order to access it's Clan page.

She follows CatLovers and returns to her timeline where she is greeted with the CatLovers Clan section, where posts on this Clan will appear.

Speaking of posts, she once again clicks on the Menu button on the navigation bar, but this time shes selects the option to create a Post.

She then decides to modify the clan's description and the clan's image to something more insightful. (Edit clan)

She writes a welcome message and selects CatLovers as the Clan where she wants the post to appear in.

She then decides to update the post, changing the post's description.

Finally, she selects the Profile option in the Menu context bar and clicks on Edit, in order to change her profile picture to her cat, Whiskers.
